### Joshua Project
```{r}

```

### Bible Translation Urgency Index

The Bible Translation Urgency Index is a score measuring the urgency of the necessity for a Bible translation of a given language. The score ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 being the least urgent, and 1 being the most urgent. Two metrics are used in the calculation of this score: the Bible translation status of the given language, and its number of speakers.

All languages lacking a complete Bible translation were ordered proportionally by population of speakers on a scale from 1 to 4, with 4 being the largest population, and 1 being the smallest population. The Bible translation status of each language was subtracted from this population score, and the remaining positive differences were also ordered proportionally on a scale from 0 to 1. The remaining values describe each language’s urgency score. 


This index assumes that languages with larger speaker populations more urgently need translations so as to prioritise delivery of the Gospel to as many people as possible as quickly as possible. It also weighs existing translation progress such that languages with less progress are deemed more urgent.  A necessary drawback of this index is that smaller languages are categorised as ‘lower priority’, regardless of existing translation progress, as the sheer number of speakers of larger languages outweigh smaller languages. The formulation of this index highlights large languages with no translation progress, which is reflected in the fact that the 12 languages with the largest urgency scores each have speaker populations above 1.4 million but Joshua Project Bible statuses of 1, i.e. no translation progress.

### Bible Translation Urgency Index Map

This map displays all of the world’s languages that have an urgency score as coloured points. The 12 largest languages are bigger than the rest of the points to highlight their urgency above smaller languages. The colour of each point represents the urgency of its translation; darker points represent more urgency, and lighter points represent less urgency. 

### BIble Translation Status Map

This map displays all of the world’s languages that lack a full translation of the Bible as coloured points. The size of each point is proportional to the number of speakers of that language, and its colour represents the progress of its translation as per its Bible status according to Joshua Project. Darker points represent less translation progress, and lighter points represent more translation progress.

### World Watch List

The World Watch List is a ranking of countries created by Open Doors USA to measure the persecution levels of Christians around the world. Each country is assigned a score from 0 to 100 based on extensive questionnaires covering six areas of life: private life, family life, community life, national life, church life, and violence. 
In addition to a total score, each country also receives an individual score for each of these areas of life. We have thus created a map for the Total Score, as well as a map for each area of life. Dark red represents higher scores and thus greater levels of persecution, while light red to yellow represent lower scores and thus lower levels of persecution. 

### Government Restrictions Index

The Government Restrictions Index (GRI) measures government laws, policies and actions that restrict religious beliefs and practices. The GRI comprises 20 measures of restrictions, including efforts by government to ban particular faiths, prohibit conversion, limit preaching or give preferential treatment to one or more religious groups. - Pew Research Center

### Social Hostilities Index

The Social Hostilities Index (SHI) measures acts of religious hostility by private individuals, organizations or groups in society. This includes religion-related armed conflict or terrorism, mob or sectarian violence, harassment over attire for religious reasons and other forms of religion-related intimidation or abuse. The SHI includes 13 measures of social hostilities. - Pew Research Center
