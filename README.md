<h1>Global Christianity Data Visualization Project</h1> 
A web app built in R Shiny for users to explore global Christianity data from Joshua Project, World Watch List, and a variety of datasets.
This project is supported by <strong> Gordon College Career and Connection Institute, Indigitous U.S., and Joshua Project</strong>.
You can access the current version here: http://global-christianity-dataviz.shinyapps.io/demo

## Project Background
The Joshua Project is a Christian mission organization that statistically potrays the unreached people groups in the world. Per records, there are 17400 people's group in the world, Joshua Project tracks the mission work and evangelism progress within these people groups. Our project "Global Christianity Data Visualization Project" used Joshua's Project raw data and visualizations, world watch list and a variety of other data sets to create a product that better displays the world mission status.  
   
## Purpose & Use
The main purpose of this project is to improve the Joshua's project currect visualization and create new metrics that provide more content to the term ***unreached*** with the aim of motivating and encouraging missionaries and other parties interested to direct there attention and resources towards the unreached peoples group.

## Strategy
Develop new and improved maps, charts, graphs in the Joshua Project using modern visualization techniques and practices
Merge Joshua Project's data sets with external data sets such us data on Gross Domestic Product of each country to create a holistic perspective and open the posibility of creating new metrics such us the Government Restriction index and Social Holistic index.

Examples of new metrics created

Create interactive lists of unreached people groups and frontier people groups with new metrics that provide more context and features.

## Looking forward 
Eventually the hope is to redesign the entire website of Joshua project by incoporating all content on shiny as a prototype for future development.
This will involve adding Joshua Project's API, refining our methodology, introducing new data sets, improving more static visualizations, and creating new metrics to enhance a holistic perspective and close informational gaps.
